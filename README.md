# **Northcoders News (Front-end)**

FE-NC-News is a React-based front-end for a social news platform, similar to Reddit. It connects to a back-end API to display, rate, and discuss articles. Skills and Technologies: React for UI, React Router for navigation, Axios for API requests, Tailwind CSS for styling, Vite for development, ESLint for code quality, Git for version control, and JavaScript (ES6+). HTML & CSS were also used. Project Description: FE-NC-News was part of the Northcoders News project to consolidate my understanding of building a full CRUD application. It allowed users to browse articles by topic, upvote/downvote, comment, and submit articles. Project Overview: The app included key features like article display, rating, comments, and topic filtering, using React Router for navigation. I used React for state management, Axios for API interaction, and Tailwind for UI. I focused on recreating a Reddit-like experience with Northcoders-specific content. Error handling and dynamic updates for upvotes and comments were also implemented.

Northcoders News (Front-end) is a **React application** built as the counterpart to the backend northcoders news (BE-NC-news) accessible on github. Many of React's newer features such as hooks, function component memoization, and more have been employed throughout, utilising function components over class components throughout the codebase in order to reduce overhead for the transpiler. The project relies upon React's Context API for application state management.

## UI Design
 Special attention was paid to ensure the design was as responsive as possible across all devices, and that good accessibility practices were employed throughout.
